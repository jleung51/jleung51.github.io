[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/76673fc3-1989-4df0-957a-1640e5ce7177/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/jleung/deploys)

My personal website, built on React.

## Setup

The website requires [NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/) to build and deploy.

Install the necessary packages:
```shell
npm install
```

Start the server locally:
```shell
npm start
```

The server will be available on port 3000 (http://127.0.0.1:3000).

### Building a Production Release

To build the app for production, run:
```shell
npm run build
```

The resulting website will be in the `build/` folder, minified and ready for release.
